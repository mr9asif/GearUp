# 📖 Project Overview

GearUp is a multi-role equipment rental management system built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL**.

The platform supports three different user roles:

- 👤 Customer
- 🏪 Provider
- 👑 Admin

Customers can browse sports gear, rent equipment, complete secure payments using Stripe, track rental status, and leave reviews.

Providers manage their gear inventory, receive rental requests, and update rental progress.

Administrators manage users, categories, gear listings, and monitor the overall platform.
